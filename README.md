# ♟️ ProjetJeuxEchecs

A C++ chess game with a Qt-based graphical interface, built as part of the INF1015 course at Polytechnique Montréal. This project demonstrates strong object-oriented design, exception handling, and namespace management in a fun and challenging game development context.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Full chess logic implementation (legal moves, check, checkmate)
- 🖥️ GUI using **Qt5**
- 🔁 Turn-based gameplay for two players
- ♟️ Support for all standard pieces: Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King
- 🧠 Exception-safe architecture using C++ best practices
- 🧩 Organized with namespaces and modular code structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++17**
- **Qt 5 Framework**
- **CMake** (for build configuration)
- **Object-Oriented Design** principles
- **Custom exception classes** for error management

---

## 🧾 Requirements
